# Donuts Galaxy

This experiment is an attempt to clone [ilithya.rocks](https://www.ilithya.rocks) after completing the

### Challenges

Some challenges I faced and how I solved them:

1. **Scene background**: The texture was made in Adobe illustrator, placing the triangle roughly at the center of the square.
  Then setting it up like this:

  ```javascript
  const textureLoader = new TextureLoader()
  textureLoader.load('/img/donut-galaxy-bg-texture.jpg', (texture) => {
    texture.wrapS = RepeatWrapping
    texture.wrapT = RepeatWrapping
    texture.repeat.set(21, 21)
    scene.background = texture
  })
  ```

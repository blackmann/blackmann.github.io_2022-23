# Wave motion

This is a WebGL project completed with [threejs](https://threejs.org). I made the renders with Blender. Hover over a
_robo_ item to experience the waves.

<div className="row">
  <div className='col col--6'>
    <WaveMotion image="/img/0012.jpg" model="Sigma" number="XXIV">
      <p>Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.</p>
    </WaveMotion>
  </div>

  <div className='col col--6'>
    <WaveMotion image="/img/0013.jpg" model="Omega" number="MMXXI">
      <p>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer defeat.</p>
      <p>If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.</p>
    </WaveMotion>
  </div>
</div>

# Let me plant a seed

You got here because you must have heard a lot of buzz around the tech industry; especially the software industry. Yupp,
on this side, the grass is greener 🍀. I testify!

> Don't get me wrong. I am not testifying it's all _rainbows 🌈 and unicorns_ 🦄. But yes, its greener!

In just the past decade, the way we live our lives have changed rapidly that we're even trying to catch up.
Internet speed is in the multiple of hundreds of megabytes. I recently used to laugh at the fact I once called 240kb per
second fast.
And that, it was even okay for me to wait a week for something to download completely.

Nowadays, I download 40gb worth of files in 30 minutes.

Our movie 🎬 qualities have changed. CGI looks so real you can never tell if the movie involved real humans.

Social media has enabled so many opportunities for businesses and even individuals and some of us cannot still fathom
that people make a living by just being _social media influencers_. To the older people, they call it a craze.
To the younger ones, it's the normal.

Not to digress too far, you'll realize a lot of these changes revolve around the screens of our mobile phones 📲 or
computers. In other words, we're in the age where we want things to happen with the use of our mobile phone and also
keep up to date with what's happening.

The computer 💻 or mobile phone has become the interface to so many possibilities.
People who have found ways to create these interfaces have made more fortunes.
In simpler words, people who have found ways to use our computers or mobile phones to solve [even simple] day-to-day
problems have made millions in wealth.

However, the good thing is that, there are more problems to be solved. More areas to cover.
And even for existing _interfaces_, they're yet to reach perfection.

> "But I don't come from a tech background. What's my use?"

_Tech_ is nothing on its own. Tech will be useless if there were no real-world problems.
And to assure you, whatever background you have, tech may already be playing a certain amount of role in it.
If you're an accountant, you may be using Microsoft Excel.
If you're a teacher 👩🏽‍, you may rely on the combination of Microsoft Word and Google/Wikipedia searches 🔍 to build
some knowledge base.

To build upon the example of the teacher, it may be better if you could organize topics with sources, citations and
keywords.
Such a problem is something a teacher can have the best insight on.

_Are you getting some ideas now?_

Great.

The idea I'm trying to sell here is that whatever non-tech background you come from, it presents a new set of problems
for tech to solve. You may not have the skills, but it'll be better if you knew the possibilities.

So I'm encouraging everyone with slight interest in tech to pursue that interest to depths it leads.

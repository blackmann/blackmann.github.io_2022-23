# Introduction

When you watch a lot of movies or commercials involving having to code, it seems the person knows what he/she is doing
from start to finish. On the contrary, that's not what happens in real life. Rarely, does any developer just start
coding from top to bottom and have a perfectly running application.

In the real world, source codes span multiple files, depend on many libraries and frameworks and require some _
discipline_.

## Goal

What this set of articles aim to provide is a simple formula to give you a head-start when solving problems. The _
advise_ and tips I share are as result of over many years of working experience. What this means is that, you can follow
these tips verbatim in most cases and will mostly work.

Note that, the point of these articles aren't about **typing code**; they're about coming up with a solution. So, even
though the ideas shared here are [programming] language agnostic, I'll use Javascript for demonstrations.

## Primitives

Every language comes with a set of primitives. _What are primitives?_ Primitives can be seen as the capabilities a
language offers in its bare minimum. In other words, what can you do with just the language if you don't have to rely on
any add-ons. Primitives include the data structures, utility functions and keywords, etc.

We're going to explore the common primitives available to a lot of languages and how they apply to parts of real world
applications.

### Variables

### Booleans

### Numbers

### Strings

### Arrays

### Loops

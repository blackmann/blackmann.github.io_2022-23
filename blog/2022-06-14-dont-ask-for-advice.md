Probably sounds confusing. But this is the best _advice_ you'll get. 😅

<!-- truncate -->

Weeks ago, a friend in the States reached out to me about choosing between a coding bootcamp (his father is willing to
sponsor) and becoming an automotive 🏁 apprentice. A short background about my friend, Nick, is that he really likes cars.
If you follow him on Instagram, you'll understand his obsession about sport cars especially. He just graduated from
high school and is waiting to get into college.

In the meantime, he needs to spend his _vacation_ wisely.

His dad, being totally convinced software engineering really pays, does not offer his sponsorship on the merit Nick's
passion but for what he _imagines_ is the right thing for Nick to do (for his future).

This places Nick in the position of having to defend his passion for cars or simply enrol into the bootcamp.

_The automotive apprenticeship was free._

## Bias

If you were in my shoes - having to respond/advise Nick, what would you tell him to do? Take a second to think about it.

Saying "Bro, do what you want" is not an option. It's equivalent to you saying nothing at all or if he never reached out.
You've got to help him pick a side.

Without thinking much, this is easy. There are two options:

- I can use my experience and benefits as a software developer to make him choose what his dad is offering
- I can use the passion that drove me into tech as an example for Nick to stick with his

In either cases, there's bias. Bias from my own experiences. We (or I) can only speak of the world as we perceive it.
But Nick is here for an answer God would give!

## Advisee

We've all been in situations where we have to choose between [seemingly] equally balanced choices. 
In my experience, this happens when we're trying to apply logic all the way. 
But with the switch turned off on logic, we can choose.

What I'm trying to say is that we mostly do know what we want, but remain indecisive because we fear 
judgement or think we'll lose favor from people (who care about us) that had different expectations about us.

But when we ask advice for what to choose from other people (with the expectation of some magic words), 
we put them in a situation of overwhelming responsibility of our lives where when their suggestion goes wrong
they're mostly to blame for (or carry the guilt).

Rather, can we ask for support? Can we ask for help with what we decide?

If it's for the fear of failing that we want a [supposedly] expert/neutral advice, what's the guarantee the 
advisor is going to be right?

Any advice given will still send you back dealing with stuff on your own. In such cases, it's easy to take [almost] 
all the credit when there's success or assign blame when there's a failure.

With support on the other hand, you're asking the person to help with the choice you've made. 
To chip in when they can. To share their resources and perspectives - all while keeping you in absolute control.
In this case you don't leave the advisor worthless when you don't take their advice anyway.

> Not all advice are meant to be taken though. And advisors don't have to be disappointed.

## Advisor

If you've been asked to help someone make a decision before, you can remember that you have always 
hesitated to give a direction. And even when you do, you keep highlighting how unsure you can be about
a couple of stuff.

It's simply difficult.

And people don't take the advice anyway. Well, mostly!

Let's run a revolution. Let's ask _advisees_ to choose and then offer our support. 
Let's not attempt to skew their judgement in any way.

This way feels like an invitation to truly help and to feel less guilty when things don't turn out right.

## Support

The idea I want to pass along is that lets not ask for advice (in most cases), because it's a very heavy burden on the 
advisor.

Asking for support means you're convicted in your choice and any form of help can really push you farther ahead.
If you don't believe in a choice you're about to make, who will? If you're not going to go with what's advised, why ask?
If the advisor wouldn't be there while you go through it, what's the point?

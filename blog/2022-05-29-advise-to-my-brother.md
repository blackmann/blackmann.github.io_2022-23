title: What I told my younger brother on our way to admit him into SHS

Three weeks ago, I had to send my younger brother to boarding school. It was a long ride - almost 2 hours long.
So that was an opportunity to plant some seed into his head.

<!-- truncate -->

I actually started off by stating that he didn't need to listen to me because normally, 
people know what they want and advice means nothing in a lot of cases. But I was going to talk anyway, 
and it's up to him to take it or leave it.

What did I say?

## Friendships and fun

When I was in class 5, I had a friend who always talked about becoming an engineer. 
He would want to invent this or that. From my memory, I liked to listen to him. 
I had inspiration from a lot of stuff he used to say. Even though there were little to no access to 
engineering materials, my imagination became useful. I started having ideas too. 
I started drawing futuristic devices.

> Ideas came from Sci-fi movies too. I would pay attention to the cool stuff, draw them later and imagine
> the process it would involve to make them. (I knew zero about computers at this time - never held one.)

I don't remember the name<sup>1</sup> of this friend of mine, but he was definitely smarter and more ambitious than I was.
I don't know where he is right now but where I am now is evidence of the impact of having good friendships.

So I encouraged my brother to make good friends, especially with people better than him. 
There's this saying - _when you're among three idiots, you become the fourth idiot and if you're among 3 smart people, 
you become the fourth smart person_.

I also asked him to engage in sports, be competitive and always win. This is to boost his confidence by the time he's 
out of Senior High.

## Leadership

I wanted him to pick up leadership roles. I didn't give him any reason why he should but this was merely 
to teach him about being responsible.

Given that he was the class prefect for his class during Junior High School, I believe he has some 
leadership qualities, and I wanted him to nurture them.

> We need more leaders (or people with leadership qualities) in this country.

## Hard work and integrity

I know he must have heard the controversy around the education system - going to school doesn't guarantee you'll get a 
job or even become successful. _I agree_. So it makes sense not to take school seriously.

But why should he? My brother (15 yo) does not run a business or take care of a family. 
He simply has to go through school, implying that he needs to study. 

Now, since all he has to do is study, doing that well and passing his tests shows a sign of goodwill. 
It shows that given any situation he's going to give out his best and that being good at one thing translates 
into being good at many other things.

It shows that given another chance at something else, it'll be easier for me (or anybody else) to trust that he's going 
to excel.

I told him studying hard and doing well at school will create an image of integrity in the eyes of his colleagues 
and teachers, and he's going to be respected for that.

<br />

â€¦

<br />

That's it. I hope these seeds fell on fertile soil. 
I've got high hopes for what/who he'll become after completing school. I wish him good luck.

I've seen a lot of absolute beginners struggle to find their bearings around programming.
There's so much noise (from lots of YouTube tutorial to Twitter threads).
But the pattern they're able to recognize from all these are that people know what they're doing.

## The cheat code

It appears the people they look up to have understood the formula. They've figured out some cheat code.
_"Look at how everything comes easy to them. Gods!"_ Even as an experienced developer, I've had times like these
when I watch people post and talk on advanced techniques.

I believe this is because behind every nice and perfectly put content, there's no tag like
`10 failures, 4 misconceptions, 3 breaks`. There's simply the content.

Our mind is not in the business of worrying about that - only cares about becoming masters too.

## A creative skill

Let's do some exercises.

1. Pick one of the best songs from one of your favorite artists. Do you think he/she came back from lunch one afternoon,
went to the studio and created a bang?

2. How long do you think it took Da Vinci to paint the Mona Lisa? Why did it take that long to paint a portrait on such
a small canvas? Wasn't he a master?

#### So what is a creative skill?

A creative skill is about creating a personalized version of some reality.
This personal_ized_ version only has vague ideas of how the original is made or looks like but
not a complete a deviation from what it is.

This means that, if you used a lot of assumptions in creating this version, that's creative.

If you even modified the original idea by 1%, that's creative. The craziest form of creativity
are those that combine a number of different _realities_ (seemingly unrelated to each other) to create something that's
still relatable.

> I doubt any creative artifact is 100% (or even 90%) original

#### What's common about any form of creative skill?

The answer is that, there's not a definitive way of getting everything done. Your favorite artist definitely has
already created hundreds of songs before this. Shouldn't it be way easier to create bangers back-to-back with far less
effort?

The answer is no. The idea is to create [new versions] of songs that wouldn't sound like something we've heard before.
Surely, that must require some ingenuity and wouldn't use the exact composition as the last hit.

Contrast this with financial accounting, for example. It's simple, credit what comes in, debit what goes out.
Yes, there'll be different forms transactions but there's a finite set of rules to follow. You can't choose to credit
based on your feelings - you'll get into trouble.

> Freedom. That's what separates creative from non-creative skills.

So what has all these blabbing got to do with programming?

## Programming

How's programming a creative skill? Let's take messaging apps for example. I'm confident you can mention at least
three different apps. Even though they all offer the basic functionalities of communicating with people (or bots), their
respective creators tried to do or add something different. Something they think is cool or important or simply prefer.

Just like an artist will produce a song that millions of people will love, the same goes for an app.
This custom version of an app will also be loved by many people.

Now this custom version doesn't have to be radically different. Sometimes, it can just be an addition of a single
feature that the original idea may be lacking. This feature can be a selling point - one that a lot of people will
be willing to switch over.

Understanding this is vital to keep you going as a beginner. I've had a lot of people complain to me about being
confused on what the next steps after learning a language's basics are. The answer is simple, be creative.
That tutorial you completed, do it again all by yourself. This time, do something different. Personalize it.

Change colors or layouts. Host it. Add a missing feature! That's basically it. This exercise is an attempt to test
your understanding of the _vocabularies_ you learn and to train your mind on how to use what you learn
in different ways guided by your imagination.

## Vocabularies

Vocabularies in a natural language (like English) means words or combinations of words you can use to express thoughts.
Being able to play with words while being able to express an idea clearly shows your mastery of the language.
Let's take the phrase "he dropped on the floor like a sack of potatoes". A non-English (or a toddler) speaking
person learning English will simply say "he fell". This is obvious. Why?
Because they do not know a lot of words or idioms. But with time and learning, they come to know all of these.

Also, having a huge bank of vocabularies is what separates a mediocre artist from a very good one. You listen and you
smile.

> Vocabularies exist in all forms of creativity.

The same concept applies to programming. As you learn, you should be picking up vocabularies to express your ideas.
For example, say you learned how to use `for` loops to print numbers from 1 to 10, you can build on this _vocabulary_
to print the multiples of 3. You could also use the idea to find something in an array/list. How? Can you try being
creative?

So as you learn any concept in programming, pick it up as a vocabulary and try to imagine (or test) how you can be
creative with it in a different scenario.


## Failures and straight lines

One thing beginners dread is failure.

If something goes wrong it's hard. It simply shows they're not smart to understand something somewhat obviously simple.
This is a wrong mindset. Pick up a new natural language like French or Spanish for example. You'll experience this
same kind of difficulty.

It's just natural for new things to feel difficult at first. Remember learning to ride a bike?

Failures are double-edged swords. On one side, they teach you how to not do something. On the other hand, _that way not
to do something_ is a way to do something else. At the end of the day, you learn something that can be used in future
while trying to make things work.


## Form principles

Forming good principles around learning programming will help you become a good developer in the long term.
These are things you can come up with by yourself with experience, but I'll share some of mine:

- Always reference official documentations first. It's tempting to be in a hurry and only search for direct answers
  from Stackoverflow. This is detrimental in the long run. Answers you find on Stackoverflow are mostly answers to
  common problems. As you advance, the probability of finding answers on Stackoverflow shrinks significantly
  (to almost zero). Learning to navigate through official docs will be your greatest asset.

- Draw solutions in a notebook before attempting to code it. Being able to map out your thought process on paper
  tests your understanding of the problem and solution to use. Going to straight to your screen to brute-force your
  solution will lead you nowhere.

- Be open-minded to different options to a tech. It's good to try out the options and understand what strengths and
  weaknesses they offer.

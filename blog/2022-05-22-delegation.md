Save money or save time. You can't save both.

<!--truncate-->

I do a lot recently. I lead two active projects<sup>1</sup> part-time and have a full-time frontend developer role to
deal with.
Meanwhile, I have in the pipeline another startup I want to set up. And I like to try new/work on novel stuff (
experiments).

My responsibilities are growing. But the size of the time to use remains the same every day - 24hours.

## Past attempts

In the past, I used to cut out social activities as an attempt to charge my focus on doing more and avoid distractions.
For the many times that I've tried this, I burn out after a few weeks.
Leaving me useless for a couple of days; having me to gather momentum again.

I've also attempted to cut down what I do. But this means I only have to focus on my full-time job and one other
activity
(could be side-project or another gig). _Three is a lot!_ But the secondary activity can mostly grow to the size of my
full-time job bringing
me back to square one (doing a lot).

> This could be me not being able to relax. Hopefully, it's not a medical condition. ðŸ˜…

I have been very experimental in ways to do more and still have enough time for personal and social activities.

## Eureka

Earlier last week, I was having a conversation with my partner on a project. I had to complete some 3D model.
I had started to work on this project many weeks ago but couldn't get back to it. I had also promised to be making
incremental
changes. But other stuff were competing for my attention _(and they mostly won)_.

Now, it was time answer "How far?". I had to be honest.

During the discussion, it just hit me I could hire someone on Fiverr to do this job.
I should have thought about that; if only I knew the concept of **delegation**. If only, I had
it as one of my productivity techniques - we would have progress by now.

## What it's worth

> An average of about $300 for a freelance 3d artist.

Is it worth delegating? I know a little much about modeling<sup>2</sup>.
But it'll take me weeks of intermittent progress to complete this job. On aggregate, I could average spending about
10-12 hours on it.

An expert could spend a week (aggregate 6 hours) on it. And even apply best practices.
Paying $300 for this job will require me to work 6 hours<sup>2</sup> on my full-time job to make up for it. So let's
compare!

I do it my self; spend 10 hours and lose 500$ (worth of productivity) from my full-time job.
Which means I'll be paying out of my pocket (say, money made from past work).
(And less likely to have production-ready quality)

I delegate; I get (most probably, better) results in a sooner time, lose $300 but this money will be made while the work
was being done.

> I acknowledge that delegating does not always guarantee a good work will be done (without supervision).

## Is it worth it?

You can only judge after you get any result.

I think finding the right person to delegate a job to is critical to getting what's worth. 
And you'll have to come up with methods to perform due diligence against candidates.

_This is more like choosing your poison. (On many phases - whether to delegate and to whom)_

But I'm going to close this thought with a quote from John C. Maxwell:

> "If you want to do a few small things right, do them yourself. If you want to do great things and make a big impact, learn to delegate."

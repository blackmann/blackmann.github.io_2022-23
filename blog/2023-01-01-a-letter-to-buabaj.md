Hi buabaj_,

Let's define "making history". Making history means doing something notable that is still talked about by future generations â€” by making an impact or causing pain. An example will be the life of Hitler or Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. Making history is an **ambition**. Making history is daring to do what has never been done before â€” then it becomes an example.

If you agree with this definition, then you can continue reading...

Growing up (or say, having lived over 2 decades) in Ghana, your experiences have been shaped by the good, the bad and ugly things about your country. This is also true for anyone else belonging to another country. And if you grew up from a middle or lower class family, majority of the life is about combating hardship. This is simply psychological.

So any little glimpse of paradise from a 1000 miles away looks like the hope. But we should recognize that people have travelled to this country and built fortunes. People from developed countries even! In fact, I'm part of Andela and I'm always fascinated by the fact that a unicorn grew from leveraging African talents. _We, Africans, sent Andela where it was._

Thankfully, the world is reaching complete globalization. And as an ambitious individual, you have the opportunity to leverage resources (network and funds) from across the world to make an impact in your country. I think people get it wrong â€” making an impact here doesn't mean you should just stay in Ghana and squeeze water out of stone. You can travel and make connections and wealth with the goal of transforming an aspect of the country.

I believe this stage is open and a lot of people have taken it for their personal and generational reasons. But for anyone wanting to do something for their country and continent, it's time to be more aware and take it.

But how's that making history?

If you're saddened by the sanitation state of your region, or the health sector or the schools or the rail roads, these are opportunities to make history. This is an opportunity to be called the Father of the Rails ðŸ¤­. You're more likely not going to compete with a lot of people. You'll be the first to set a record. You'll be an inspiration to many generations to come.

This surely sounds like an unusual conversation because there's so much to complain about and mostly the conversation ends at making money.

"No other country can give you this opportunityâ€¦"

This is definitely not 100% true, but it is 95% of the time. And even if it were 100% a lie, why not have an impact in your country. I think it'll take time to adjust in another person's country, understand the people and culture and finally figure out what problems they have or what opportunities are there for you to make history. How certain you're the only one working on it? I think for developed countries the chances are really low.

The greener pastures we look to travel to got there with people wanting to have an impact (in the name of their country). That is why they proudly identify as themselves and why we envy.

We need to have more ambitious conversations.

Yupp, the leaders. And when we say leaders, political leaders. And that's what we've all grown to know. And they are actually the saturated form of leaders we know. But we can start having non-political leaders that also _herd_ us. Hopefully, one day you can become that type of leader.

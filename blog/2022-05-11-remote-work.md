Early 2020 I quit my on-site full-time developer role to become a freelancer.
Freelancing is the closest to what remote work is about.
Mid 2021, I applied and got into [Andela](https://andela.com) and was assigned my first contract.
In this blog post, I aim to share my experience and what it means for developers interested in remote/offshore
opportunities.

## 2020

This is when I went full-time freelancing.
I was on a stable gig that lasted almost a year and also picked up a couple of other short term gigs.
Most of the time during this period I was shuffling through at most 2 gigs at the same time.
Without revealing any specifics, I was basically doing fine financially, but I was hurting mentally.

Constantly having to _context-switch_ between projects. Keeping up with deadlines while trying to have a life for
myself.

Freelancing is great. You demand/negotiate your worth. Often in multiples your full-time job's equivalent.
You define the scope, budget the time and resources. In short, you're the boss.

But freelancing also places you in the state of _survival_.
That is, since you are never sure of a constant supply of clients, you have two options: charge more - limited client
pool _or_ charge less - unlimited client pool.

**I charged more** and provided very quality services besides just _code_.
But I also ended up with clients that are fresh _techpreneurs_.
Dealing with them was very overwhelming even though I was mostly educating and providing insights.

## 2021

Part of this year's resolution was to quit freelancing, build and launch my startup ([Adeton](https://adeton.io)), then
prepare to interview at Google.

I lived off some savings during the first quarter while working on Adeton. I was beginning to run low on cash.
So I was like _dammit_, I'm going to apply for [Andela](https://andela.com)<sup>2</sup> and hopefully get a fulltime job
then prepare for Google later.

It was until over a month I got matched with a company.

I was going to be making lots of money. Lots, when I saw my offer.

## Work scope

Now this was the first time I was working for a company this huge. Had a sweet onboarding experience.
And work was being cut for me. I had tickets with clear descriptions to tackle. So what?

So I'm going to say, compared to my freelancing experience, I was working a very small fraction but earning a huge
multiple. My life was never the same. Now I had more focus, time and _money_.<sup>3</sup>

## My life

This opportunity really opened my eyes to the possibilities of remote work. I thank God for the birth of this concept.
How am I (located in Ghana ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­) able to work across the Pacific Ocean and have an impact on the lives of millions in
another region?
It's just so amazing.

I have also been able to save a lot and can also afford a lot of things I want. I'm also able to support my family.

## What does it mean to you?

I have a few ideas.

Tech opportunities in developing countries aren't lucrative.
Mostly because founders struggle to fund the business and lack proper management and compensation schemes.

Also, there aren't a lot of companies that offer growth opportunities.

Without the knowledge of remote work _and what it can offer like good working environment and networking opportunities_,
you'll be left scrambling for the next better option in your country which is just an iota of difference with the previous
opportunity.

Now, for a lot of us, we learned this trade by unconventional means. We can code, very well. Mostly from scratch.
But we have never seen codebases of larger organizations. How to architect and build dynamic services. How to handle
user data. How to deal with tech debts, etc.

Luckily, big organizations are offering remote opportunities. This is the chance. Take it!

Early 2020 I quit my on-site full-time developer role to become a freelancer.
Freelancing is the closest to what remote work is about.
Mid 2021, I applied and got into [Andela](https://andela.com) and was assigned my first contract.
In this blog post I aim to share my experience and what it means for developers interested in remote/offshore
opportunities.
